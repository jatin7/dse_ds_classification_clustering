Can I use Machine Learning with Apache Spark with Wine and Chocolate?
-- Can I use clustering ML algorithms to find which wine comes from which
vineyard?
-- Can I use classification ML algorithms to find which country a candy bar
comes from?
-- Data Analytics doesn’t have to be complicated!
-- We are going to utilize the power of Big Data using
– Apache Cassandra
– Apache Spark
– Spark Machine Learning library
-- Kmeans
-- Naive Bayes
– Jupyter notebooks
– Python
